# S1-03-Arrays 
  Level 1 - Exercise 2

  ## Description 
 Create a program that has an indexed array of 6 elements and then:
    Display the size of the previous array on the screen.
    Remove an element from the previous array.
    Check that the array indices are normalized (their indices must be reorganized so that there are no gaps between indices).
    Display the size of the array and its contents one last time.
