# S1-03-Arrays 
  Level 1 - Exercise 3

## Description 
Create a function that receives an array of words and a character as parameters. 
The function returns true if all the words in the array have the character passed as the second parameter.

For example: 
If we have [“hello”, “Php”, “Html”], it will return true if we ask for ‘h’ but false if we ask for “l”.
